the little love-god lying once asleep
laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand
whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep
came tripping by but in her maiden hand
the fairest votary took up that fire
which many legions of true hearts had warmed
and so the general of hot desire
was sleeping by a virgin hand disarmed
this brand she quenched in a cool well by
which from love's fire took heat perpetual
growing a bath and healthful remedy
for men discased but I my mistress' thrall
came there for cure and this by that I prove
love's fire heats water water cools not love
