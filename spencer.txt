happy ye leaves when as those lily hands
which hold my life in their dead-doing might 
shall handle you and hold in love's soft bands 
like captives trembling at the victor's sight 
and happy lines on which with starry light
those lamping eyes will deign sometimes to look 
and read the sorrows of my dying sprite 
written with tears in heart's close-bleeding book 
and happy rhymes bath'd in the sacred brook
of helicon whence she derived is 
when ye behold that angel's blessed look 
my soul's long-lacked food my heaven's bliss 
leaves lines and rhymes seek her to please alone
whom if ye please I care for other none
unquiet thought whom at the first I bred
of th' inward bale of my love-pined heart 
and sithens have with sighs and sorrows fed 
till greater then my womb thou woxen art 
break forth at length out of the inner part
in which thou lurkest like to viper's brood 
and seek some succour both to ease my smart 
and also to sustain thy self with food 
but if in presence of that fairest proud
thou chance to come fall lowly at her feet 
and with meek humbless and afflicted mood 
pardon for thee and grace for me entreat 
which if she grant then live and my love cherish
if not die soon and I with thee will perish
thou sovereign beauty which I do admire
witness the world how worthy to be praised 
the light whereof hath kindled heavenly fire 
in my frail spirit by her from baseness raised 
that being now with her huge brightness dazed
base things I can no more endure to view 
but looking still on her I stand amazed 
at wondrous sight of so celestial hew 
so when my tongue would speak her praises due
it stopped is with thought's astonishment 
and when my pen would write her titles true 
it ravished is with fancy's wonderment 
yet in my heart I then both speak and write
the wonder that my wit cannot endite
new year forth looking out of janus' gate
doth seem to promise hope of new delight 
and bidding th' old adieu his passed date 
bids all old thoughts to die in dumpish sprite 
and calling forth out of sad winter's night
fresh love that long hath slept in cheerless bower 
wills him awake and soon about him dight 
his wanton wings and darts of deadly power 
for lusty spring now in his timely hour
is ready to come forth him to receive 
and warns the earth with diverse colored flower 
to deck herself and her fair mantle weave 
then you fair flower in whom fresh youth doth rain
prepare yourself new love to entertain
rudely thou wrongest my dear heart's desire
in finding fault with her too portly pride 
the thing which I do most in her admire 
is of the world unworthy most envied 
for in those lofty looks is close implied
scorn of base things and sdeigne of foul dishonor 
threatening rash eyes which gaze on her so wide 
that loosely they ne dare to look upon her 
such pride is praise such portliness is honor
that boldened innocence bears in her eyes 
and her fair countenance like a goodly banner 
spreads in defiance of all enemies 
was never in this world ought worthy tried
without some spark of such self-pleasing pride
be not dismayed that her unmoved mind
doth still persist in her rebellious pride 
and love not like to lusts of baser kind 
the harder won the firmer will abide 
the durefull oak whose sap is not yet dried
is long ere it conceive the kindling fire 
but when it once doth burn it doth divide 
great heat and makes his flames to heaven aspire 
so hard it is to kindle new desire
in gentle breast that shall endure for ever 
deep is the wound that dints the parts entire 
with chaste affects that naught but death can sever 
then think not long in taking little pain
to knit the knot that ever shall remain
fair eyes the mirror of my mazed heart
what wondrous virtue is contained in you 
the which both life and death forth from you dart 
into the object of your mighty view 
for when ye mildly look with lovely hew
then is my soul with life and love inspired 
but when ye lour or look on me askew 
then do I die as one with lightning fired 
but since that life is more than death desired
look ever lovely as becomes you best 
that your bright beams of my weak eyes admired 
may kindle living fire within my breast 
such life should be the honor of your light
such death the sad ensample of your might
more than most fair full of the living fire
kindled above unto the maker near 
no eyes but joys in which all powers conspire 
that to the world naught else be counted dear 
through your bright beams doth not the blinded guest
shoot out his darts to base affections wound 
but angels come to lead frail minds to rest 
in chaste desires on heavenly beauty bound 
you frame my thoughts and fashion me within
you stop my tongue and teach my heart to speak 
you calm the storm that passion did begin 
strong through your cause but by your virtue weak 
dark is the world where your light shined never
well is he born that may behold you ever
long-while I sought to what I might compare
those powerful eyes which lighten my dark sprite 
yet find I nought on earth to which I dare 
resemble th'image of their goodly light 
not to the sun for they do shine by night
nor to the moon for they are changed never 
nor to the stars for they have purer sight 
nor to the fire for they consume not ever 
nor to the lightening for they still persever
nor to the diamond for they are more tender 
nor unto crystal for nought may them sever 
nor unto glass such baseness mought offend her 
then to the maker self they likest be
whose light doth lighten all that here we see
unrighteous lord of love what law is this
that me thou makest thus tormented be 
the whiles she lordeth in licentious bliss 
of her freewill scorning both thee and me 
see how the tyraness doth joy to see
the huge massacres which her eyes do make 
and humbled hearts brings captives unto thee 
that thou of them mayst mighty vengeance take 
but her proud heart do thou a little shake
and that high look with which she doth comptroll 
all this world's pride bow to a baser make 
and all her faults in thy black book enroll 
that I may laugh at her in equal sort
as she doth laugh at me and makes my pain her sport
daily when I do seek and sew for peace
and hostages do offer for my truth 
she cruel warrior doth herself address 
to battle and the weary war renew'th 
nor will be moved with reason or with ruth
to grant small respite to my restless toil 
but greedily her fell intent persueth 
of my poor life to make unpityed spoil 
yet my poor life all sorrows to assoyle
I would her yield her wrath to pacify 
but then she seeks with torment and turmoil 
to force me live and will not let me die 
all pain hath end and every war hath peace
but mine no price nor prayer may surcease
one day I sought with her heart-thrilling eyes
to make a truce and terms to entertain 
all fearless then of so false enemies 
which sought me to entrap in treason's train 
so as I then disarmed did remain
a wicked ambush which lay hidden long 
in the close court of her guileful eyen 
thence breaking forth did thick about me throng 
too feeble I t'abide the brunt so strong
was forced to yield myself into their hands 
who me captiving straight with rigorous wrong 
have ever since me kept in cruel bands 
so lady now to you I do complain
against your eyes that justice I may gain
in that proud port which her so goodly graceth
whiles her fair face she rears up to the sky 
and to the ground her eyelids low embaseth 
most goodly temperature ye may descry 
mild humbless mixed with awful majesty
for looking on the earth whence she was born 
her mind remembreth her mortality 
what so is fairest shall to earth return 
but that same lofty countenance seems to scorn
base thing and think how she to heaven may climb 
treading down earth as lothsome and forlorn 
that hinders heavenly thoughts with drossy slime 
yet lowly still vouchsafe to look on me
such lowliness shall make you lofty be
return again my forces late dismayed
unto the siege by you abondon'd quite 
great shame it is to leave like one afraid 
so fair a peace for one repulse so light 
'gainst such strong castles needeth greater might
than those small forts which ye were wont belay 
such haughty minds enur'd to hardy fight 
disdain to yield unto the first assay 
bring therefore all the forces that ye may
and lay incessant battery to her heart 
plaints prayers vows ruth sorrow and dismay 
those engines can the proudest love convert 
and if those fail fall down and die before her
so dying live and living do adore her
ye tradefull merchants that with weary toil
do seek most precious things to make your gain 
and both the indias of their treasures spoil 
what needeth you to seek so far in vain 
for lo my love doth in her self contain
all this world's riches that may far be found 
if saphires lo her eyes be saphires plain 
if rubies lo her lips be rubies sound 
if pearls her teeth be pearls both pure and round
if ivory her forhead ivory weene 
if gold her locks are finest gold on ground 
if silver her fair hands are silver sheen 
but that which fairest is but few behold
her mind adorned with virtues manifold
one day as I unwarily did gaze
on those fair eyes my love's immortal light 
the whiles my 'stonished heart stood in amaze 
through sweet illusion of her look's delight 
i mote perceive how in her glancing sight
legions of loves with little wings did fly 
darting their deadly arrows fiery bright 
at every rash beholder passing by 
one of those archers closely I did spy
aiming his arrow at my very heart 
when suddenly with twinkle of her eye 
the damsel broke his misintended dart 
had she not so done sure I had been slain
yet as it was I hardly 'scaped with pain
the glorious portrait of that angel's face
made to amaze weak men's confused skill 
and this world's worthless glory to embase 
what pen what pencil can express her fill 
for though he colours could devise at will
and eke his learned hand at pleasure guide 
least trembling it his workmanship should spill 
yet many wondrous things there are beside 
the sweet eye-glances that like arrows glide
the charming smiles that rob sense from the heart 
the lovely pleasance and the lofty pride 
cannot expressed be by any art 
a greater craftsman's hand thereto doth need
that can express the life of things indeed
the rolling wheel that runneth often round
the hardest steel in tract of time doth tear 
and drizling drops that often do redound 
the firmest flint doth in continuance wear 
yet cannot I with many a dropping tear
and long entreaty soften her hard heart 
that she will once vouchsafe my plaint to hear 
or look with pity on my painful smart 
but when I plead she bids me play my part
and when I weep she says tears are but water 
and when I sigh she says I know the art 
and when I wail she turns herself to laughter 
so do I weep and wail and plead in vain
whiles she as steel and flint doth still remain
the merry cuckoo messenger of spring
his trumpet shrill hath thrice already sounded 
that warns all lovers wait upon their king 
who now is coming forth with garland crowned 
with noise whereof the choir of birds resounded
their anthems sweet devised of love's praise 
that all the woods their echoes back rebounded 
as if they knew the meaning of their lays 
but 'mongst them all which did love's honor raise
no word was heard of her that most it ought 
but she his precept proudly disobeys 
and doth his idle message set at nought 
therefore o love unless she turn to thee
ere cuckoo end let her a rebel be
in vain I seek and sue to her for grace
and do mine humbled heart before her pour 
the whiles her foot she in my neck doth place 
and tread my life down in the lowly floor 
and yet the lion that is lord of power
and reighneth over every beast in field 
in his most pride disdaineth to devour 
the silly lamb that to his might doth yield 
but she more cruel and more savage wild
then either lion or lioness 
shames not to be with guiltless blood defiled 
but taketh glory in her cruelness 
fairer than fairest let none ever say
that ye were blooded in a yielded prey
was it the work of nature or of art
which tempered so the feature of her face 
that pride and meekness mixed by equal part 
do both appear t'adorn her beauty's grace 
for with mild pleasance which doth pride displace
she to her love doth lookers' eyes allure 
and with stern countenance back again doth chase 
their looser looks that stir up lusts impure 
with such strange terms her eyes she doth inure
that with one look she doth my life dismay 
and with another doth it straight recure 
her smile me draws her frown me drives away 
thus doth she train and teach me with her looks
such art of eyes I never read in books
this holy season fit to fast and pray
men to devotion ought to be inclined 
therefore I likewise on so holy day 
for my sweet saint some service fit will find 
her temple fair is built within my mind
in which her glorious image placed is 
on which my thoughts do day and night attend 
like sacred priests that never think amiss 
there I to her as th'author of my bliss
will build an altar to appease her ire 
and on the same my heart will sacrifice 
burning in flames of pure and chaste desire 
the which vouchsafe o godess to accept
amongst thy dearest relics to be kept
penelope for her ulysses' sake
devised a web her wooers to deceive 
in which the work that she all day did make 
the same at night she did again unreave 
such subtle craft my damsel doth conceive
th'importune suit of my desire to shun 
for all that I in many days do weave 
in one short hour I find by her undone 
so when I think to end that I begun
I must begin and never bring to end 
for with one look she spills that long I spun 
and with one word my whole year's work doth rend 
such labour like the spider's web I find
whose fruitless work is broken with least wind
when I behold that beauty's wonderment
and rare perfection of each goodly part 
of nature's skill the only complement 
I honor and admire the maker's art 
but when I feel the bitter baleful smart
which her fair eyes unwares do work in me 
that death out of their shiny beams do dart 
I think that I a new pandora see 
whom all the gods in council did agree
into this sinful world from heaven to send 
that she to wicked men a scourge should be 
for all their faults with which they did offend 
but since ye are my scourge I will intreat
that for my faults ye will me gently beat
how long shall this like dying life endure
and know no end of her own mystery 
but waste and wear away in terms unsure 
'twixt fear and hope depending doubtfully 
yet better were at once to let me die
and show the last ensample of your pride 
than to torment me thus with cruelty 
to prove your power which I too well have tried 
but yet if in your hardened breast ye hide
a close intent at last to show me grace 
then all the woes and wrecks which I abide 
as means of bliss I gladly will embrace 
and wish that more and greater they might be
that greater meede at last may turn to me
sweet is the rose but grows upon a briar
sweet in the juniper but sharp his bough 
sweet is the eglantine but pricketh near 
sweet is the firbloom but his branches rough 
sweet is the cypress but his rind is tough
sweet is the nut but bitter is his pill 
sweet is the broom-flower but yet sour enough 
and sweet is moly but his root is ill 
so every sweet with sour is tempered still
that maketh it be coveted the more 
for easy things that may be got at will 
most sorts of men do set but little store 
why then should I account of little pain
that endless pleasure shall unto me gain
fair proud now tell me why should fair be proud
sith all world's glory is but dross unclean 
and in the shade of death itself shall shroud 
but ever now thereof ye little weene 
that goodly idol now so gay beseen
shall doff her flesh's borrowed fair attire 
and be forgot as it had never been 
that many now much worship and admire 
ne any then shall after it inquire
ne any mention shall thereof remain 
but what this verse that never shall expire 
shall to you purchase with her thankless pain 
fair be no longer proud of that shall perish
but that which shall you make immortal cherish
the laurel leaf which you this day do wear
gives me great hope of your relenting mind 
for since it is the badge which I do bear 
ye wearing it do seem to me inclined 
the power thereof which of in me I find
let in likewise your gentle breast inspire 
with sweet infusion and put you in mind 
of that proud maid whom now those leave attire 
proud daphne scorning phoebus' lovely fire
on the thessalian shore from him did fly 
for which the gods in their revengeful ire 
did her transform into a laurel tree 
then fly no more fair love from phoebus' chace
but in your breast his leaf and love embrace
see how the stubborn damsel doth deprave
my simple meaning with disdainful scorn 
and by the bay which I unto her gave 
accounts myself her captive quite forlorn 
the bay (quoth she) is of the victors borne
yielded them by the vanquished as their meeds 
and they therewith do poets' heads adorn 
to sing the glory of their famous deeds 
but sith she will the conquest challenge needs
let her accept me as her faithful thrall 
that her great triumph which my skill exceeds 
I may in trump of fame blaze over all 
then would I deck her head with glorious bays
and fill the world with her victorious praise
my love is like to ice and I to fire
how comes it then that this her cold so great 
is not dissolved through my so-hot desire 
but harder grows the more I her intreat 
or how comes it that my exceeding heat
is not delayed by her heart frozen cold 
but that I burn much more in boiling sweat 
and feel my flames augmented manifold 
what more miraculous thing may be told
that fire which all things melts should harden ice 
and ice which is congealed with senseless cold 
should kindle fire by wonderful device 
such is the power of love in gentle mind
that it can alter all the course of kind
ah why hath nature to so hard a heart
given so goodly gifts of beauty's grace
whose pride depraves each other better part
and all those pretty ornaments deface
sith to all other beasts of bloody race
a dreadful countenance she given hath
that with their terror all the rest may chase
and warn to shun the danger of their wrath
but my proud one doth work the greater scath
through sweet allurement of her lovely hue
that she the better may in bloody bath
of such poor thralls her cruel hands embrew
but did she know how ill these two accord
such cruelty she would have soon abhored
the painful smith with force of fervent heat
the hardest iron soon doth mollify
that with his heavy sledge he can it beat
and fashion to what he it list apply
yet cannot all these flames in which I fry
her heart more hard than iron soft a whit
ne all the plaints and prayers with which i
do beat on th'anvil of her stubborn wit
but still the more she fervent sees my fit
the more she frieseth in her willful pride
and harder grows the harder she is smit
with all the plaints which to her be applied
what then remains but I to ashes burn
and she to stones at length all frozen turn
great wrong I do I can it not deny
to that most sacred empress my dear dread
not finishing her queen of fa&edry
that mote enlarge her living praises dead
but lodwick this of grace to me aread
do ye not think the'accomplishment of it
sufficient work for one man's simple head
all were it as the rest but rudely writ
how then should I without another wit
think ever to endure so tedious toil
sins that this one is tossed with troublous fit
of a proud love that both my spirit spoil
cease then till she vouchsafe to grant me rest
or lend you me another loving breast
like a ship that through the ocean wide
by conduct of some star doth make her way
whenas a storm hath dimmed her trusty guide
out of her course doth wander far astray
so I whose star that wont with her bright ray
me to direct with clouds is overcast
do wander now in darkness and dismay
through hidden perils round about me plast
yet hope I well that when this storm is past
my helice the lodestar of my life
will shine again and look on me at last
with lovely light to clear my cloudy grief
till then I wander carefull comfortless
in secret sorrow and sad pensiveness
my hungry eyes through greedy covetize
still to behold the object of their pain
with no contentment can themselves suffice
but having pine and having not complain
for lacking it they cannot life sustain
and having it they gaze on it the more
in their amazement like narcissus vain
whose eyes him starv'd so plenty makes me poor
yet are mine eyes so filled with the store
of that fair sight that nothing else they brook
but loath the things which they did like before
and can no more endure on them to look
all this world's glory seemeth vain to me
and all their shows but shadows saving she
tell me when shall these weary woes have end
or shall their ruthless torment never cease
but all my days in pining langor spend
without hope of aswagement or release
is there no means for me to purchase peace
or make agreement with her thrilling eyes
but that their cruelty doth still increase
and daily more augment my miseries
but when ye have shewed all extermities
then think how little glory ye have gained
by slaying him whose life though ye dispise
mote have your life in honour long maintained
but by his death which some perhaps will moan
ye shall condemned be of many a one
what guile is this that those her golden tresses
she doth attire under a net of gold
and with sly skill so cunningly them dresses
that which is gold or hair may scarce be told
is it that men's frail eyes which gaze too bold
she may entangle in that golden snare
and being caught may craftily enfold
their weaker hearts which are not well aware
take heed therefore mine eyes how ye do stare
henceforth too rashly on that guileful net
in which if ever ye entrapped are
out of her bands ye by no means shall get
fondness it were for any being free
to covet fetters though they golden be
arion when through tempests' cruel wrack
he forth was thrown into the greedy seas
through the sweet music which his harp did make
allured a dolphin him from death to ease
but my rude music which was wont to please
some dainty ears cannot with any skill
the dreadful tempest of her wrath appease
nor move the dolphin from her stubborn will
but in her pride she doth persever still
all careless how my life for her decays
yet with one word she can in save or spill
to spill were pitty but to save were praise
choose rather to be praised for doing good
than to be blam'd for spilling guiltless blood
sweet smile the daughter of the queen of love
expressing all thy mother's powerful art
with which she wonts to temper angry jove
when all the gods he threats with thund'ring dart
sweet is thy virtue as thy self sweet art
for when on me thou shinedst late in sadness
a melting pleasance ran through every part
and me revived with heart robbing gladness
whylest rapt with joy resembling heavenly madness
my soul was ravished quite as in a trance
and feeling thence no more her sorrow's sadness
fed on the fullness of that cheerful glance
more sweet than nectar or ambrosial meat
seemed every bit which thenceforth I did eat
mark when she smiles with amiable cheer
and tell me whereto can ye liken it
when on each eyelid sweetly do appear
an hundred graces as in shade to sit
likest it seemeth in my simple wit
unto the fair sunshine in summer's day
that when a dreadful storm away is flit
through the broad world doth spread his goodly ray
at sight whereof each bird that sits on spray
and every beast that to his den was fled
comes forth afresh out of their late dismay
and to the light lift up their drooping head
so my storm-beaten heart likewise is cheered
with that sunshine when cloudy looks are cleared
is it her nature or is it her will
to be so cruel to an humbled foe
if nature then she may it mend with skill
if will then she at will may will forgo
but if her nature and her will be so
that she will plague the man that loves her most
and take delight t'increase a wretch's woe
then all her nature's goodly gifts are lost
and that same glorious beauty's idle boast
is but a bait such wretches to beguile
as being long in her love's tempest tossed
she means at last to make her piteous spoil
of fairest fair let never it be named
that so fair beauty was so foully shamed
the love which me so cruelly tormenteth
so pleasing is in my extremest pain
that all the more my sorrow it augmenteth
the more I love and do embrace my bane
ne do I wish (for wishing were but vain)
to be acquit from my continual smart
but joy her thrall for ever to remain
and yield for pledge my poor captived heart
the which that it from her may never start
let her if please her bind with adamant chain
and from all wandering loves which mote pervert
his safe assurance strongly it restrain
only let her abstain from cruelty
and do me not before my time to die
shall I then silent be or shall I speak
and if I speak her wrath renew I shall
and if I silent be my heart will break
or choked be with overflowing gall
what tyranny is this both my heart to thrall
and eke my tongue with proud restraint to tie
that neither I may speak nor think at all
but like a stupid stock in silence die
yet I my heart with silence secretly
will teach to speak and my just cause to plead
and eke mine eyes with meek humility
love-learned letters to her eyes to read
which her deep wit that true hearts' thought can spell
will soon conceive and learn to construe well
when those renowned noble peers of greece
through stubborn pride amongst themselves did war
forgetful of the famous golden fleece
then orpheus with his harp their strife did bar
but this continual cruel civil war
the which myself against myself do make
whilest my weak powers of passions warried are
no skill can stint nor reason can aslake
but when in hand my tuneless harp I take
then do I more augment my foes' despight
and grief renew and passions do awake
to battle fresh against myself to fight
'mongst whom the more I seek to settle peace
the more I find their malice to increase
leave lady in your glass of crystal clean
your goodly self for evermore to view
and in myself my inward self I mean
most lively like behold your semblance true
within my heart though hardly it can shew
thing so divine to view of earthly eye
the fair idea of your celestial hue
and every part remains immortally
and were it not that through your cruelty
with sorrow dimmed and deformed it were
the goodly image of your visnomy
dearer than crystal would therein appear
but if yourself in me ye plain will see
remove the cause by which your fair beams darkened be
when my abode's prefixed time is spent
my cruel fair straight bids me wend my way
but then from heaven most hideous storms are sent
as willing me against her will to stay
whom then shall I or heaven or her obey
the heavens know best what is the best form
but as she will whose will my life doth sway
my lower heaven so it perforce must be
but ye high heavens that all this sorrow see
sith all your tempests cannot hold me back
aswage your storms or else both you and she
will both together me too sorely wrack
enough it is for one man to sustain
the storms which she alone on me doth rain
trust not the treason of those smiling looks
until ye have their guilefull trains well tried
for they are like but unto golden hooks
that from the foolish fish their baits do hide
so she with flattering smiles weak hearts doth guide
unto her love and tempt to their decay
whom being caught she kills with cruel pride
and feeds at pleasure on the wretched pray
yet even whilst her bloody hands them slay
her eyes look lovely and upon them smile
that they take pleasure in her cruel play
and dying do themselves of pain beguile
o mighty charm which makes men love their bane
and think they die with pleasure live with pain
innocent paper whom too cruel hand
did make the matter to avenge her ire
and ere she could thy cause well understand
did sacrifice unto the greedy fire
well worthy thou to have found better hire
then so bad end for heretics ordained
yet heresy nor treason didst conspire
but plead thy master's cause unjustly pained
whom she all careless of his grief contrained
to utter forth the anguish of his heart
and would not hear when he to her complained
the piteous passion of his dying smart
yet live for ever though against her will
and speak her good though she requite it ill
fair cruel why are you so fierce and cruel
is it because your eyes have power to kill
then know that mercy is the mightiest jewel
and greater glory think to save than spill
but if it be your pleasure and proud will
to show the power of your imperious eyes
then not on him that never thought you ill
but bend your force against your enemies
let them feel th'utmost of your cruelties
and kill with looks as cockatrices do
but him that at your footstool humbled lies
with merciful regard give mercy to
such mercy shall you make admired to be
so shall you live by giving life to me
long languishing in double malady
of my heart's wound and of my body's grief
there came to me a leach that would apply
fit medicines for my body's best relief
vain man (quoth i) that hast but little priefe
in deep discovery of the mind's disease
is not the heart of all the body chief
and rules the members as itself doth please
then with some cordials seek first to appease
the inward langour of my wounded heart
and then my body shall have shortly ease
but such sweet cordials pass physicians' art
then my life's leach do you your skill reveal
and with one salve both heart and body heal
do I not see that fairest images
of hardest marble are of purpose made
for that they should endure through many ages
ne let their famous monuments to fade
why then do I untrained in lovers' trade
her hardness blame which I should more commend
sith never aught was excellect assayed
which was not hard t'achieve and bring to end
ne aught so hard but he that would attend
mote soften it and to his will allure
so do I hope her stubborn heart to bend
and that it then more steadfast will endure
only my pains will be the more to get her
but having her my joy will be the greater
so oft as homeward I from her depart
I go like one that having lost the field
is prisoner led away with heavy heart
despoiled of warlike arms and knowen shield
so do I now myself a prisoner yield
to sorrow and to solitary pain
from presence of my dearest dear exiled
longwhile alone in languor to remain
there let no thought of joy or pleasure vain
dare to approach that may my solace breed
but sudden dumps and dreary sad disdain
of all worlds gladness more my torment feed
so I her absence will my penance make
that of her presence I my mead may take
the panther knowing that his spotted hide
doth please all beasts but that his looks them fray
within a bush his dreadful head doth hide
to let thm gaze whilst he on them may prey
right so my cruel fair with me doth play
for with the goodly semblance of her hue
she doth allure me to mine own decay
and then no mercy will unto me shew
great shame it is thing so divine in view
made for to be the world's most ornament
to make the bait her gazers to enbrew
good shames to be too ill an instrument
but mercy doth with beauty best agree
as in their maker ye them best may see
of this world's theatre in which we stay
my love like the spectator idly sits
beholding me that all the pageants play
disguising diversely my troubled wits
sometimes I joy when glad occasion fits
and mask in mirth like to a comedy
soon after when my joy to sorrow flits
I wail and make my woes a tragedy
yet she beholding me with constant eye
delights not in my mirth nor rues my smart
but when I laugh she mocks and when I cry
she laughs and hardens evermore her heart
what then can move her if not mirth nor moan
she is no woman but senseless stone
so oft as I her beauty do behold
and therewith do her cruelty compare
I marvel of what substance was the mould
the which her made at once so cruel fair
not earth for her high thoughts more heavenly are
not water for her love doth burn like fire
not air for she is not so light or rare
not fire for she doth freeze with faint desire
then needs another element inquire
whereof she mote be made that is the sky
for to the heaven her haughty looks aspire
and eke her mind is pure immortal high
then sith to heaven ye likened are the best
be like in mercy as in all the rest
fair ye be sure but cruel and unkind
as is the tiger that with greediness
hunts after blood when he by chance doth find
a feeble beast doth felly him oppress
fair be ye sure but proud and pityless
as is a storm that all things doth prostrate
finding a tree alone all comfortless
beats on it strongly it to ruinate
fair be ye sure but hard and obstinate
as is a rock amidst the raging floods
'gainst which a ship of succour desolate
doth suffer wreck both of herself and goods
that ship that tree and that same beast am i
whom ye do wreck do ruin and destroy
sweet warrior when shall I have peace with you
high time it is this war now ended were
which I no longer can endure to sue
ne your incessant battery more to bear
so weak my powers so sore my wounds appear
that wonder is how I should live a jot
seeing my heart through launched everywhere
with thousand arrows which your eyes have shot
yet shoot ye sharply still and spare me not
but glory think to make these cruel stoures
ye cruel one what glory can be got
in slaying him that would live gladly yours
make peace therefore and grant me timely grace
that all my wouds will heal in little space
by her that is most assured to herself
weak is th'assurance that weak flesh reposeth
in her own power and scorneth others' aid
that soonest falls when as she most supposeth
herself assured and is of nought afraid
all flesh is frail and all her strength unstayed
like a vain bubble blown up with air
devouring time and changeful chance have preyed
her glory's pride that none may it repair
ne none so rich or wise so strong or fair
but faileth trusting on his own assurance
and he that standeth on the highest stair
falls lowest for on earth nought hath endurence
why then do ye proud fair misdeem so far
that to yourself ye most assured are
thrice happy she that is so well assured
unto herself and settled so in heart
that neither will for better be allured
ne feared with worse to any chance start
but like a steady ship doth strongly part
the raging waves and keeps her course aright
ne aught for tempest doth from it depart
ne aught for fairer weather false delight
such self assurance need not fear the spite
of grudging foes ne favor seek of friends
but in the stay of her own steadfast might
neither to one herself nor another bends
most happy she that most assured doth rest
but he most happy who such one loves best
they that in course of heavenly spheres are skilled
to every planet point his sundry year
in which her circle's voyage is fulfilled
as mars in three-score years doth run his sphere
so since the winged God his planet clear
began in me to move one year is spent
the which doth longer unto me appear
than all those forty which my life outwent
then by that count which lovers' books invent
the sphere of cupid forty years contains
which I have wasted in long languishment
that seemed the longer for my greater pains
but let my love's fair planet short her ways
this year ensuing or else short my days
the glorious image of the maker's beauty
my sovereign saint the idol of my thought
dare not henceforth above the bounds of duty
t'accuse of pride or rashly blame for aught
for being as she is divinely wrought
and of the brood of angels heavenly born
and with the crew of blessed saints upbrought
each of which did her with their gifts adorn
the bud of joy the blossom of the morn
the beam of light whom mortal eyes admire
what reason is it then but she should scorn
base things that to her love too bold aspire
such heavenly forms ought rather worshipped be
than dare be lov'd by men of mean degree
the weary year his race now having run
the new begins his compassed course anew
with shew of morning mild he hath begun
betokening peace and plenty to ensue
so let us which this change of weather view
change each our minds and former lives amend
the old year's sins forepast let us eschew
and fly the faults with which we did offend
then shall the new year's joy forth freshly send
into the glooming world his gladsome ray
and all these storms which now his beauty blend
shall turn to calms and timely clear away
so likewise love cheer you and your heavy sprite
and change old year's annoy to new delight
after long storms and tempests' sad assay
which hardly I endured heretofore
in dread of death and dangerous dismay
with which my silly bark was tossed sore
I do at length descry the happy shore
in which I hope ere long for to arrive
fair soil it seems from far and fraught with store
of all that dear and dainty is alive
most happy he that can at last achieve
the joyous safety of so sweet a rest
whose least delight sufficeth to deprive
remembrance of all pains which him oppressed
all pains are nothing in respect to this
all sorrows short that gain eternal bliss
coming to kiss her lips (such grace I found)
me seemed I smelled a garden of sweet flowers
that dainty odors from them threw around
for damsels fit to deck their lovers' bowers
her lips did smell like unto gillyflowers
her ruddy cheeks like unto roses red
her snowy brows like budded bellamores
her lovely eyes like pinks but newly spread
her goodly bosom like a strawberry bed
her neck like to a bunch of columbines
her breast like lillies ere their leaves be shed
her nipples like young blossomed jasmines
such fragrant flowers do give most odorous smell
but her sweet odor did them all excel
the doubt which you misdeem fair love is vain
that fondly fear to lose your liberty
when losing one two liberties you gain
and make him bond that bondage erst did fly
sweet be the bands the which true love doth tie
without constraint or dread of any ill
the gentle bird feels no captivity
within her cage but sings and feeds her fill
there pride dare not approach nor discord spill
the league 'twixt them that loyal love hath bound
but simple truth and mutual good will
seeks with sweet peace to salve each others' wound
there faith doth fearless dwell in brazen tower
and spotless pleasure builds her sacred bower
to all those happy blissing which ye have
with plenteous hand by heaven upon you thrown
this one disparagement they to you gave
that ye your love lent to so mean a one
yet whose high worths surpassing paragon
could not on earth have found one fit for mate
ne but in heaven matchable to none
why did ye stoop unto so lowly state
but ye thereby much greater glory gate
than had ye sorted with a prince's peer
for now your light doth more itself dilate
and in my darkness greater doth appear
yet since your light hath once enlumined me
with my reflex yours shall increased be
like as a huntsman after weary chase
seeing the game from him escaped away
sits down to rest him in some shady place
with panting hounds beguiled of their pray
so after long pursuit and vain assay
when I all weary had the chase forsook
the gentle deer returned the self-same way
thinking to quench her thirst at the next brook
there she beholding me with milder look
sought not to fly but fearless still did bide
till I in hand her yet half-trembling took
and with her own goodwill here firmly tied
strange thing me seemed to see a beast so wild
so goodly won with her own will beguiled
most glorious lord of life that on this day
didst make thy triumph over death and sin
and having harrowed hell didst bring away
captivity thence captive us to win
this joyous day dear lord with joy begin
and grant that we for whom thou didst die
being with thy dear blood clean washed from sin
may live for ever in felicity
and that thy love we weighing worthily
may likewise love thee for the same again
and for thy sake that all like dear didst buy
with love may one another entertain
so let us love like as we ought
love is the lesson which the lord us taught
the famous warriors of the antick world
used trophies to erect in stately wise
in which they would the records have enrolled
of their great deeds and valorous emprize
what trophy then shall I most fit devise
in which I may record the memory
of my love's conquest peerless beauty's prize
adorn'd with honour love and chastity
even this verse vowed to eternity
shall be thereof immortal monument
and tell her praise to all posterity
that may admire such world's rare wonderment
the happy purchase of my glorious spoil
gotten at last with labour and long toil
fresh spring the herald of love's might king
in whose coat-armor richly are displayed
all sorts of flowers the which on earth do spring
in goodly colors gloriously displayed
go to my love where she is careless laid
yet in her winter's bower not well awake
tell her the joyous time will not be staid
unless she do him by the forelock take
bid her therefore herself soon ready make
to wait on love amongst his lovely crew
where every one that misseth than her make
shall be by him amearst with penance due
make haste therefore sweet love whilst it is prime
for none can call again the passed time
I joy to see how in your drawen work
yourself unto the bee ye do compare
and me unto the spider that doth lurk
in close await to catch her unaware
right so youself were caught in cunning snare
of a dear foe and thralled to his love
in whose straight bands ye now captived are
so firmly that ye never may remove
but as your work is woven all above
with woodbine flowers and fragrant eglantine
so sweet your prison you in time shall prove
with many dear delights bedecked fine
and all thenceforth eternal peace shall see
between the spider and the gentle bee
I oft when my spirit doth spread her bolder wings
in mind to mount up to the purest sky
it down is weighed with thought of earthly things
and clogged with burden of mortality
where when that sovereign beauty it doth spy
resembling heaven's glory in her light
drawn with sweet pleasure's bait it back doth fly
and unto heaven forgets her former flight
there my frail fancy fed with full delight
doth bathe in bliss and mantleth most at ease
ne thinks of other heaven but how it might
her heart's desire with most contentment please
heart need not with none other happiness
but here on earth to have such heaven's bliss
being myself captured here in care
my heart whom none with servile bands can tie
but the fair tresses of your golden hair
breaking his prison forth to you doth fly
like as a bird that in one's hand doth spy
desired food to it doth make his flight
even so my heart that wont on your fair eye
to feed his fill flys back unto your sight
do you him take and in your bosom bright
gently encage that he may be your thrall
perhaps he there may learn with rare delight
to sing your name and praises over all
that it hereafter may you not repent
him lodging in your bosom to have lent
most happy letters fram'd by skillful trade
with which that happy name was first designed
the which three times thrice happy hath me made
with gifts of body fortune and of mind
the first my being to me gave by kind
from mother's womb deriv'd by due descent
the second is my sovereign queen most kind
that honour and large riches to me lent
the third my love my life's last ornament
by whom my spirit out of dust was raised
to speak her praise and glory excellent
of all alive most worthy to be praised
ye three elizabeths forever live
that three such graces did unto me give
one day I wrote her name upon the strand
but came the waves and washed it away
again I wrote it with a second hand
but came the tide and made my pains his prey
vain man said she that doest in vain assay
a mortal thing so to immortalize
for I myself shall like to this decay
and eek my name be wiped out likewise
no so (quod i) let baser things devise
to die in dust but you shall live by fame
my verse your virtues rare shall eternize
and in the heavens write your glorious name
where whenas death shall all the world subdue
out love shall live and later life renew
fair bosom fraught with virtue's riches treasure
the nest of love the lodging of delight
the bower of bliss the paradise of pleasure
the sacred harbour of that heavenly sprite
how was I ravished with your lovely sight
and my frail thoughts too rashly led astray
whiles diving deep through amorous insight
on the sweet spoil of beauty they did prey
and twixt her paps like early fruit in may
whose harvest seemed to hasten now apace
they loosly did their wanton wings display
and there to rest themselves did boldly place
sweet thoughts I envy your so happy rest
which oft I wished yet never was so blest
was it a dream or did I see it plain
a goodly table of pure ivory
all spread with juncats fit to entertain
the greatest prince with pompous royalty
'mongst which there in a silver dish did lie
two golden apples of unvalued price
far passing those which hercules came by
or those which atalanta did entice
exceeding sweet yet void of sinful vice
that many sought yet none could ever taste
sweet fruit of pleasure brought from paradise
by love himself and in his garden placed
her breast that table was so richly spread
my thoughts the guests which would thereon have fed
lacking my love I go from place to place
like a young fawn that late hath lost the hind
and seek each where where last I saw her face
whose image yet I carry fresh in mind
I seek the fields with her late footing signed
I seek her bower with her late presence decked
yet nor in field nor bower I her can find
yet field and bower are full of her aspect
but when mine eyes I thereunto direct
they idly back return to me again
and when I hope to see their true object
I find myself but fed with fancies vain
cease then mine eyes to seek herself to see
and let my thoughts behold herself in me
men call you fair and you do credit it
for that yourself ye daily such do see
but the true fair that is the gentle wit
and virtuous mind is much more prayed of me
for all the rest how ever fair it be
shall turn to naught and loose that glorious hue
but only that is permanent and free
from frail corruption that doth flesh ensue
that is true beauty that doth argue you
to be divine and born of heavenly seed
deriv'd from that fair spirit from whom all true
and perfect beauty did at first proceed
he only fair and what he fair hath made
all other fair like flowers untimely fade
after so long a race as I have run
through faery land which those six books compile
give leave to rest me being half fordone
and gather to myself new breath awhile
then as a steed refreshed after toil
out of my prison I will break anew
and stoutly will that second work assoyle
with strong endeavor and attention due
till then give leave to me in pleasant mew
to sport my muse and sing my love's sweet praise
the contemplation of whose heavenly hue
my spirit to an higher pitch will raise
but let her praises yet be low and mean
fit for the handmaid of the faery queene
fair is my love when her fair golden heares
with the loose wind ye waving chance to mark
fair when the rose in her red cheeks appears
or in her eyes the fire of love does spark
fair when her breast like a rich-laden bark
with precious merchandise she forth doth lay
fair when that cloud of pride which oft doth dark
her goodly light with smiles she drives away
but fairest she when so she doth display
the gate with pearls and rubies richly dight
through which her words so wise do make their way
to bear the message of her gentle sprite
the rest be works of nature's wonderment
but this the work of heart's astonishment
joy of my life full oft for loving you
I bless my lot that was so lucky placed
but then the more your own mishap I rue
that are so much by so mean love debased
for had the equal heavens so much you graced
in this as in the rest ye mote invent
soom heavenly wit whose verse could have enchased
your glorious name in golden monument
but since ye deigned so goodly to relent
to me your thrall in whom is little worth
that little that I am shall all be spent
in setting your immoral praises forth
whose lofty argument uplifting me
shall lift you up unto an high degree
my hungry eyes through greedy covetize
still to behold the object of their pain
with no contentment can themselves suffice
but having pine and having not complain
for lacking it they cannot life sustain
and seeing it they gaze on it the more
in their amazement like narcissus vain
whose eyes him starv'd so plenty makes me poor
yet are mine eyes so filled with the store
of that fair sight that nothing else they brook
but loath the things which they did like before
and can no more endure on them to look
all this world's glory seemeth vain to me
and all their shows but shadows saving she
let not one spark of filthy lustfull fire
ne one light glance of sensual desire
attempt to work her gentle mind's unrest
but pure affections bred in spotless breast
and modest thoughts breathed from well tempered sprites
go visit her in her chaste bower of rest
accompanied with angelic delights
there fill yourself with those most joyous sights
the which myself could never yet attain
but speak no word to her of these sad plights
which her too constant stiffness doth constrain
only behold her rare perfection
and bless your fortune's fair election
the world that cannot deem of worthy things
when I do praise her say I do but flatter
so does the cuckoo when the mavis sings
begin his witless note apace to clatter
but they that skill not of so heavenly matter
all that they know not envy or admire
rather than envy let them wonder at her
but not to deem of her desert aspire
deep in the closet of my parts entire
her worth is written with a golden quill
that me with heavenly fury doth inspire
and my glad mouth with her sweet praises fill
which when as fame in her shrill trump shall thunder
let the world choose to envy or to wonder
venemous tongue tipped with vile adders' sting
of that self kind with which the furies fell
their snaky heads do comb from which a spring
of poisoned words and spiteful speeches well
let all the plagues and horrid pains of hell
upon thee fall for thine accursed hire
that with false-forged lies which thou didst tell
in my true love did stir up coals of ire
the sparks whereof let kindle thine own fire
and catching hold on thine own wicked head
consume thee quite that didst with guile conspire
in my sweet peace such breaches to have bred
shame be thy meed and mischief thy reward
due to thyself that it for me prepared
since I did leave the presence of my love
many long weary days have I outworn
and many nights that slowly seemed to move
their sad protract from evening until morn
for when as day the heaven doth adorn
I wish that night the noyous day would end
and when as night hath us of light forlorn
I wish that day would shortly reascend
thus I the time with expectation spend
and fain my grief with changes to beguile
that further seems his term still to extend
and maketh every minute seem a mile
so sorrow still doth seem too long to last
but joyous hours do fly away too fast
since I have lacked the comfort of that light
the which was wont to lead my thoughts astray
I wander as in darkness of the night
afraid of every danger's least dismay
ne ought I see though in the clearest day
when others gaze upon their shadows vain
but th'only image of that heavenly ray
whereof some glance doth in mine eye remain
of which beholding the idea plain
through contemplation of my purest part
with light thereof I do myself sustain
and thereon feed my love-afamished heart
but with such brightness whilst I fill my mind
I starve my body and mine eyes do blind
like as the culver on the bared bough
sits mourning for the absence of her mate
and in her songs sends many a wishful vow
for his return that seems to linger late
so I alone now left disconsolate
mourn to myself the absence of my love
and wandering here and there all desolate
seek with my plaints to match that mournful dove
ne joy of aught that under heaven doth hove
can comfort me but her own joyous sight
whose sweet aspect both God and man can move
in her unspotted pleasauns to delight
dark is my day while her fair light I miss
and dead my life that wants such lively bliss
